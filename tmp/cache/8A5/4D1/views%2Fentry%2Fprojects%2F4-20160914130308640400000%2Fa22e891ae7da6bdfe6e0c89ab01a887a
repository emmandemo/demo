<h3>Jules with HIV</h3>
<p>
 This infant was born with HIV, the doctors said she has hope. She can be cured though her mother won't be with her for much longer but she have a chance of having a fulfilled life if we can help make that happen. Just a minor operation will save her and then we can hope to find a loving home for her.
